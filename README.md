# PowerReviews Express Widget

This repository contains files that implement a basic PowerReviews widget and a Write a Review page on your Mozu site. The widget allows you to display reviews from PowerReviews directly on product pages of your Mozu site.You can select whether to display a full review or a smaller review snippet. 

**Note:** This widget does not pass any data between Mozu and PowerReviews, and content from the reviews is not indexed for your site SEO. For a more complete PowerReviews integration, install the Mozu PowerReviews Enterprise Application from the [Mozu App Marketplace](https://www.mozu.com/ecommerce-app-center/).

This repository is structured to mirror the file structure of Mozu Core Theme, but only the necessary files for the widget are included. These files are based off Mozu Core 6. If your theme is built off a later version of the Mozu Core theme, take care when merging to ensure you do not overwrite updated theme code.

This widget adds the following files:
*	`resources/admin/widgets/power_review_icon.png`
*	`scripts/widgets/powerreviews.js`
*	`templates/modules/product/product-images.hypr.live`
*	`templates/modules/product/product-listing.hypr.live`
*	`templates/pages/resize.hypr`
*	`templates/pages/write-a-review.hypr`
*	`templates/widgets/PowerReviewsExpress/pr-product-reviews.hypr`
*	`thumb.tpt.png`

And updates the following files:
*	`scripts/modules/views-collections.js`
*	`stylesheets/pages/pr_product.css`
* `stylesheets/widgets/pr_category_override.css`
* `stylesheets/widgets/pr_product_override.css`
* `stylesheets/widgets/pr_write_review_override.css`
* `templates/pages/category.hypr`
* `theme.json`

**Note:** You must add your PowerReviews Merchant Group ID and Merchant ID under `settings` in `theme.json`.
